# Wireless Kit Addon

A plugin for users that have installed a wireless kit inside of their Wacom CTH Tablets.

This will allow you to monitor your tablet's battery as well as its charging status & get notified when the battery is low.
A tray icon will be added for each tablet that has a wireless kit installed.

You can choose your own battery percentage threshold for the notification.
